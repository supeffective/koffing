# Koffing
Koffing is a Pokemon Showdown Team parser that converts your strategies to 
machine-readable JSON code.

![koffing](docs/assets/img/koffing.png) 🔁![koffing](docs/assets/img/koffing-shiny.png)

[Pokémon Showdown](https://www.pokemonshowdown.com/) is the most popular online Pokémon battle simulator,
one of the best ways to quickly try your strategies for the official Pokémon VGC Championships. This library is just
a parser for the teams generated by the [Showdown Team Builder](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/teambuilder) exports.

This repository holds the source code for the library as well as the code for the Online Parser.
The [Online Parser](https://capsulemonsters.github.io/koffing) does not require you to download
any library or script, it is recommended if all you want is to sanitize, prettify or convert to JSON your
Showdown team exports.

## Features

- Compatible with web browsers and NodeJS, including ES6+ imports
- Converts from Showdown code to JSON
- Converts from JSON to Showdown code
- Sanitizes Showdown code (removing invalid data, applying max and mins values, etc.)
- Prettifies Showdown code (proper indentation, line breaks and sorting of the data, etc.)
- [Online Parser](https://capsulemonsters.github.io/koffing), which is using the library
featuring all the above mentioned.

## Installation

As a package:
```bash
npm i --save koffing
```

In the browser, using a CDN:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/capsulemonsters/koffing/0.4.0/dist/koffing.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Javascript (ES5, web)
```html
<script src="dist/koffing.min.js"></script>
<script>
var teamCode = `=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===`;
var parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode);
console.log(parsedTeam);

// Note that the ShowdownParser class, which is used internally by the Koffing class
// is also exposed in the global scope:
console.log(new ShowdownParser(teamCode).parse());
</script>
```

### Javascript (ES6+, universal)
```js
"use strict";

import {Koffing} from 'koffing';

const teamCode = `
=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===

let parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode);

// This will log a PokémonTeamSet object:
console.log(parsedTeam);
// Convert it back to the Showdown format (prettified):
console.log(parsedTeam.toShowdown());
// which is the same as:
console.log(parsedTeam.toString());
// and the same as:
console.log(parsedTeam + "");
// You can also convert the object to JSON:
console.log(parsedTeam.toJson());
// which is the same as:
console.log(Koffing.toJson(teamCode));
```

### NodeJS
```js
const Koffing = require('koffing').Koffing;

const teamCode = `=== [gen7] Folder 1/Example Team ===`;
let parsedTeam = Koffing.parse(teamCode);
console.log(parsedTeam);
```


## Class Reference
The `Koffing` class is basically a wrapper of the `ShowdownParser` class, the difference is that it can be used statically.

`ShowdownParser` class methods:
- `parse(): PokemonTeamSet`: Parses the Showdown code and returns a `PokemonTeamSet` object.
- `format(): String`: Parses the Showdown code and returns a prettified and sanitized version of it.
- `toString(): String`: Basically returns the internal Showdown code string as it is.

`Koffing` class methods:
- `static parse(showdownCode): PokemonTeamSet`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse()`
- `static format(showdownCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.format()`
- `static toJson(showdownCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse().toJson()`
- `static toShowdown(jsonCode): String`: Wrapper for `ShowdownParser.prototype.parse().toShowdown()`
